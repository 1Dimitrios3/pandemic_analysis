COVID-19 Global Analysis - Data Science Project

Project Overview:

This project uses Python and pandas to explore and analyze global coronavirus data, aiming to answer:

1. Which countries were most affected by COVID-19?
2. What are the ratios of population to COVID-19 cases and deaths?
3. What was the trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Greece?

Data:

The analysis is based on data stored in the following CSV files:

- coronavirus_report.csv for COVID-19 cases and deaths
- population_by_country.csv for population data

Conclusion:

Key findings from the analysis:

- The United States was the most affected country in both cases and deaths.
- From 2021 to 2022, there was a significant increase in cases and deaths, which dropped in 2023.
- The top three countries by cases: United States, India, France.
- The top three countries by deaths: United States, Brazil, India.
- Greece's COVID-19 trends were analyzed in detail.

Future Work:

Potential areas for further analysis include:

- Vaccination Impact: Study how vaccination rates influenced cases and deaths.
- Socio-Economic Factors: Explore the impact of healthcare, GDP, and population density.
- Policy Effectiveness: Evaluate the effectiveness of public health policies.
- Variant Analysis: Investigate the impact of different COVID-19 variants.
- Longitudinal Studies: Track long-term effects on health and economic recovery.
